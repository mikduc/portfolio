      <h2 className="sm text-secondary">Hello! I’m Ryan Fang, a Bachelor of Mathematics student at the University of Waterloo, majoring in Statistics. I have a strong passion for technology and enjoy working with various programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and SQL.

      I thrive on challenges, whether it’s building interactive websites with React and Bootstrap or diving into data analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib. My coursework and projects have equipped me with a solid foundation in algorithm design, data structures, and problem-solving.

      In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, exploring new tech trends, and playing video games. Let’s connect and create something amazing together!</h2>
